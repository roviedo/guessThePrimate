# I'm fascinated with[Primates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate). Well us humans are genetically very close to them.

#### Small [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) application that asks you to identify the primate and finally it gives you a score. Please correct me if I got any of the primates incorrect, sorry if I did.

### Steps to get started with this repo

```
cd /path/to/guessThePrimate
npm install
npm start

```

#### To run using [Expo](https://expo.io/)

```
cd /path/to/guessThePrimate
npm install
expo start
```
##### Then navigate to exp://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:PORT_NUMBER_OF_APP in you favorite browser on device
##### e.g. exp://192.1.2.345:19000


#### Things to improve

```
Nicer CSS and smooth animations
Loading of images
Fetching questions randomly from API/DB backend and posting answers to API/DB and retrieving score from backend
and lots more primates.
```
